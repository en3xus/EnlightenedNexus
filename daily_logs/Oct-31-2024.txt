## Updates 
This morning I woke up feeling tired, with a slight headache. This is due to the
reason that I'v been sleeping late for some days now, reading and learning
studiously about the gopher and gemini protocols and other retro technologies.
Yesterday, I also went to the farm to harvest cassava.  I was able to setup my
github page though. At least that is out of the way. Since I won't be going to
farm today, I hope to complete these tasks, as long as my phone battery permits.

## Task 
[x] Create a shell script that automate the chronological naming of files for my daily logs.
[x] Decide on a shared hosting gopher server [x]
Decide on a shared hosting gemini server
[x] Clean up my vimrc file
[x] Create a shell or vim script that auto format text into twitter number of characters.
[x] Create a github personal access token
[x] Post this on my social media
accounts



## Activities
- I was able to write the shell script. It was meant to auto create a new with the date format with an appened text.
- For the gemini and gopher hosting services, I'v choosen tilde.pink and tilde.club. I'v emailed and signed up. They demanded ssh key though, which I created.
- I'v cleaned up my vim config file and brought it down to 7 lines. For now I do not use vim for programming or coding. I just use it for writing. I noticed as I'm typing right now, the text are not indenting well and the words are breaking. So I need to add a line or two.
- I didn't create the shell script for twitter formatting again. I realised I could use vim in textwidth and gq commands.
- The github PAT was created for easy auth login to github through gh cli.
- Yes, I did post and will post this too.


## Gratitude
- I am grateful for being able to do all this today.
- I am grateful for shelter, food, and family.
- I am grateful to old time but not forgotten friends
