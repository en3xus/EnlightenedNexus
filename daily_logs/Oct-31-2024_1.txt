## Updates This morning I woke up feeling tired, with a slight headache. This is
due to the reason that I'v been sleeping late for some days now, reading and
learning studiously about the gopher and gemini protocols and other retro
technologies.  Yesterday, I also went to the farm to harvest cassava.  I was
able to setup my github page though. At least that is out of the way. Since I
won't be going to farm today, I hope to complete these tasks, as long as my
phone battery permits.

## Today's Task
- Create a shell script that automate the chronological naming of files for my
  daily logs.
- Decide on a shared hosting gopher server
- Decide on a shared hosting gemini server
- Clean up my vimrc file
- Create a shell or vim script that auto format text into twitter number of
  characters.
- Create a github personal access token
- Post this on my social media accounts
